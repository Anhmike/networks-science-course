# Practice Session 06: NetworkX and centrality

In this session we will learn to use [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), a Python package.

# 0. Reading and drawing in NetworkX

Imports:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

For reading a GML file, you use the `read_gml` method and indicate what is the name of the attribute that you want to use as a label for the nodes.

```python
gkar = nx.read_gml(path="data/karate.gml", label="id")
print("Karate Club: |V|=%d, |E|=%d" % (gkar.order(), gkar.size()))
nx.draw_spring(gkar, with_labels=True)
plt.show()

gmis = nx.read_gml(path="data/lesmiserables.gml", label="label")
print("Les MisÃ¨rables: |V|=%d, |E|=%d" % (gmis.order(), gmis.size()))
nx.draw_spring(gmis, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

The number of nodes in a graph can be obtained with `g.order()` and the number of edges with `g.size()`.

Simple CSV files of the form `source,target` can also be loaded using the `read_edgelist` function:

```python
g = nx.read_edgelist(path="data/holidays-bcn-network.csv", delimiter=",")
```

More complex CSV files are better parsed with the `csv` module; a graph can then be created programmatically.

```python
import io
import csv
import re

import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

DISORDER_FILE="data/disease-genes.csv"
DISORDER_CLASS="Respiratory"

# Create an empty graph
g = nx.Graph()

with io.open(DISORDER_FILE) as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
    for row in reader:
        disorder_class = row["Class"]

        # Select a specific class of disorder
        if disorder_class == DISORDER_CLASS:

            # Parse name and gene list
            disorder_name = row["Name"]
            disorder_genes = list(map(str.strip, row["Genes"].split(",")))
            for gene in disorder_genes:

                # Shorten the disorder name
                disorder_name = re.sub(",.*$", "", disorder_name)

                # Add the edge to the graph and report to screen
                g.add_edge(disorder_name, gene)
                print("%s - %s" % (disorder_name, gene))

print("Respiratory diseases/genes: |V|=%d, |E|=%d" % (g.order(), g.size()))
# Draw the graph
nx.draw_spring(g, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

The purpose of NetworkX is not really to draw graphs, for that there is Cytoscape and other tools. Instead, its purpose is to run algorithms on graphs.

# 1. Degree sequence and histogram for a small graph

Load the graph from *Zachary's Karate Club* in variable `g`. We will now plot its degree sequence.

```python
# Obtain degree sequence
degree_dict = dict(g.degree())
print(degree_dict)
degree_sequence = sorted(degree_dict.values(), reverse=True)
print(degree_sequence)

plt.loglog(degree_sequence,'b-',marker='o')
plt.title("Degree rank plot")
plt.ylabel("degree")
plt.xlabel("rank")
plt.show()
```

Next, we will plot its degree histogram. For this, we will use a function in `numpy` named `histogram`. Add this to the first cell of your notebook and run it:

```python
import numpy as np
```

Now you can use the following code to create the histogram. Normally the `numpy.histogram` function uses its own bins for histograms, but we are giving our own. We are also ensuring all degrees have their own bin, remember the `range` function excludes the last element of the range, plus the bins are the upper limit of each bucket, this is why we use *+2*.

We also have to remove the last bin in the end to make both lists (bins and frequencies) the same size.

```python
freq, bin_edges = np.histogram(degree_sequence, bins=range(1, np.max(degree_sequence)+2))
print(degree_sequence)
print(freq)

print(bin_edges)
bin_edges_minus_last = bin_edges[:-1]
print(bin_edges_minus_last)

plt.bar(bin_edges_minus_last, freq)
plt.title("Degree histogram")
plt.ylabel("Number of nodes")
plt.xlabel("Degree")
plt.xticks(bin_edges_minus_last)
plt.show()
```

# 2. Degree distribution for a large graph

Now let's load a larger network: `hero-network.csv`:

```python
INPUT_FILE = "data/hero-network.csv"
g = nx.Graph()

with io.open(INPUT_FILE) as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter='\t', quotechar='"')
    for row in reader:
        hero1 = row[0]
        hero2 = row[1]
        g.add_edge(hero1, hero2)

print("Hero network: |V|=%d, |E|=%d" % (g.order(), g.size()))
```

To obtain its degree sequence, we will use an ordered dictionary, which also allows us to see the hero that is associated to each value. Add `from collections import OrderedDict` to the first cell in your notebook, and then do:

```python
degree_dict = dict(g.degree())
degree_ordered = OrderedDict(sorted(degree_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))
print(degree_ordered)
degree_sequence = list(degree_ordered.values())
print(degree_sequence)
```

Now, plot its degree rank plot using the code we have seen above.

To plot its degree distribution, we will use the following:

```python
prob, bin_edges = np.histogram(degree_sequence, bins=range(1,np.max(degree_sequence)+2), density=True)
plt.loglog(bin_edges[:-1], prob, '.', marker='x')
plt.title("Probability density function")
plt.xlabel("Degree")
plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.show()
```

Observe two things in this plot. First, for smaller degrees we do not observe a power law. Second, for larger degrees the distribution is a bit *messy* because of the sparse observations. This is a fairly typical situation, so following [Adamic 2002]((http://www.labs.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html), we will use the inverse cumulative distribution function (inverse CDF) instead of the probability density function (PDF).

```python
cdf_x = sorted(degree_sequence)
cdf_y = np.array(range(len(degree_sequence)))/len(degree_sequence)

plt.loglog(cdf_x, 1-cdf_y, 'b-')
plt.title("Inverse cumulative distribution function")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("P(degree >= x)")
plt.show()
```

Next, we will select the central portion of this plot, by discarding degrees that are too low: we want to obtain a power law for the middle part of the distribution. In this case, we will discard values smaller than 30:

```python
degree_sequence_central = [d for d in degree_sequence if d >= 30]
```

Now we will fit a line to the inverse CDF plot. To ensure we obtain a line, we will first transform the data using `log()`, and then use `numpy.polyfit` to fit a polynomial of degree 1 (i.e., a line) to the data:

```python
cdf_x = sorted(degree_sequence_central)
cdf_y = np.array(range(len(degree_sequence_central)))/len(degree_sequence_central)

x_values = np.log(cdf_x)
y_values = np.log(1-cdf_y)
linmodel = np.polyfit(x_values, y_values, deg=1)
print(linmodel)
pred_y_values = list(map(lambda x: linmodel[0]*x + linmodel[1], x_values))

plt.plot(x_values, pred_y_values, 'r-')
plt.plot(x_values, y_values, 'b-')
plt.legend(['Line with slope %.1f' % linmodel[0], 'Observed'])
plt.title("Inverse cumulative distribution function (log-transformed)")
plt.xlabel("log(x)")
plt.ylabel("log(P(degree >= x))")
plt.show()
```

Now, we can return to the original data:

```python
cdf_x = sorted(degree_sequence)
cdf_y = np.array(range(len(degree_sequence)))/len(degree_sequence)
plt.loglog(cdf_x, 1-cdf_y, 'b-')
plt.loglog(cdf_x, list(map(lambda x: x**linmodel[0] * np.exp(linmodel[1]), cdf_x)))
plt.title("Inverse cumulative distribution function")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("P(degree >= x)")
plt.legend(['Cx^(%.1f)' % linmodel[0], 'Observed'])
plt.show()
```

Note that if *log(y) = a log(x) + b*, then *y = x^a e^b*, and that the displacement along the y axis of the fitted line is because the last plot includes the entire degree sequence and not just the selected values. In any case, what we care about is the slope.

# 3. Compute centrality

You can calculate various centrality metrics using NetworkX:

```python
# This should take a couple of minutes
eig_cen = nx.eigenvector_centrality(g)
# k is the number of pivots; larger k means more precision
bet_cen = nx.betweenness_centrality(g, k=50)
```

# DELIVER (individually)

At the end of the session, deliver a zip file containing your Python notebook (remove unnecessary elements, add comments when needed), and a PDF file containing, for a network (**PENDING: WHICH NETWORK? Not the same hero-network.csv**).

* The 3 nodes with the larger degree.
* A degree-rank plot
* An inverse CDF of degree with a fitted line
* The 3 nodes with the larger betweenness centrality.
* The 3 nodes with the larger eigenvector centrality (PageRank).

## Extra points available

For extra points, add a section "Extra points" to your document, and include a scatter plot containing the top nodes by degree (say, top 100). In the x axis place the degree of the node, and in the y axis the betweenness centrality of the node.

Indicate the names of the node that deviates significantly from the diagonal, i.e., has a much larger betweenness centrality considering its degree. Which kind of node may have this characteristic in this specific graph, in which an edge connect two characters that appear together in a comic?

To plot the names in a scatterplot, you can use this code. You just need to fill in the arrays x_values, y_values, and labels.

```python
plt.loglog(x_values, y_values, '.')
plt.xlabel("Degree")
plt.ylabel("Betweenness Centrality")
for i in range(len(x_values)):
    plt.text(x_values[i], y_values[i], labels[i])
plt.show()
```
