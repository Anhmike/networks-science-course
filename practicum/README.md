# Practicum

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions are conducted in a computer lab and, as a general rule, are delivered individually at the end of each session.

There are 09 practice sessions in this course. Handouts for each session start with *psNN* and describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

At the end of each handout there is a description of what you should deliver.

**Important note for the evaluation**: as a data scientist your reports and code should be (among other things) correct, easily understandable, pristine, and pleasant to look at. Check your code and results as many times as needed to ensure they are correct, and be careful with the presentation of your work. For instance, do not use low-quality screenshots, or poorly cropped screenshots showing toolbars and window borders; instead, export and save high-quality images from each application.

## Assignments

Assignments, as a general rule, are done in pairs.

There are 3 assignments in this course. Assignment descriptions start with "asNN".
