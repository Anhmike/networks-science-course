# Practicum

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions are conducted in a computer lab and, as a general rule, are delivered individually within 24 hours of the end of the session.

There are 09 practice sessions in this course. Handouts for each session start with *psNN* and describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

At the end of each handout there is a description of what you should deliver. Please ask in the course forum or to your teaching assistant ("*profesor/a de prácticas*") any questions you may have.

## Assignments

Assignments, as a general rule, are done in pairs and in your own time. There is, however, a lab session dedicated to the assignment, usually but not always close to the delivery date, in which the teaching assistant (*profesor/a de prácticas*) will answer any questions you may have. Feel free to also post questions in the course forum.

There are 3 assignments in this course. Assignment descriptions start with "asNN".

| Assignment                           | Contents |

| [AS01](as01_cytoscape_movie.md)      | Create a movie network from a movie database |
| [AS02](as02_distances_diameter.md)   | Find distances and the diameter in a network |
| [AS03](as03_pagerank.md)             | Compute PageRank with the graph in secondary memory |
