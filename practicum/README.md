# Practicum

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions are conducted in a computer lab and, as a general rule, are delivered individually within 24 hours of the end of the session.

There are 09 practice sessions in this course. Handouts for each session start with *psNN* and describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

At the end of each handout there is a description of what you should deliver. Please ask in the course forum or to your teaching assistant ("*profesor/a de pr√°cticas*") any questions you may have.
