## Acknowledgments

The course, particularly the first half, follows the [book and course on complex networks](https://www.barabasilab.com/course) by Albert-László Barabási.

I am thankful to the course's teaching assistants (2018), PhD students Alexander Gomez and Alexandra Matreata at UPF, and the feedback from Vicenç Gómez on an early version of this course.
