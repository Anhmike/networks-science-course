# Rules for course at UPF

## Grading

Continuous evaluation will be based in the following elements:

* A: Average grade in the 9 practical sessions, minus the lowest one: 30%
* B: Average grade in the 3 assignments: 20%
* C: Average grade in the 2 in-class tests: 20%
* D: Grade in the exam: 30%

To pass the course under continuous evaluation, all of the following must be true:

1. 0.6 A + 0.4 B >= 4.0
1. 0.4 C + 0.6 D >= 4.0
1. 0.3 A + 0.2 B + 0.2 C + 0.3 D >= 5.0

## Getting a grade in the practical sessions

To obtain a grade in the practical session, you must:

* Attend the practical session and sign the attendance sheet
* Deliver your work within 24 hours of the end of the practical session
* If your work is delivered after more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours, it will have a -2 points deduction
* After 48 hours, work will not be accepted

Extra points will be added to your grade, allowing you to have up to 12 points (instead of 10) in some practice sessions.

Automatically the lowest grade in the practice sessions will be discarded, which allows you to skip one session and still get the maximum grade.

Not coming to a practice session or not delivering your work means a zero grade in that session, unless you can justify your absence to the teaching assistant (*profesor de prácticas*).

**Note**: Copying from external sources without acknowledging them in your work, and copying the work from other person/group in your class, are considered by the university as serious misconduct ("*falta grave*"). The instructor will make a case for the university to sanction this serious misconduct, as per the [university regulations](https://seuelectronica.upf.edu/es/regim-disciplinari-dels-estudiants-de-la-universitat-pompeu-fabra), with a suspension from the university for a minimum of six months and a maximum of four years.

## Getting a grade in the assignments

To obtain a grade in the assignments, you must:

* Deliver the assignment on time
* If your work is delivered after the deadline, but within 24 hours of the deadline, it will have a -2 points deduction
* After 24 hours, work will not be accepted

Not delivering an assignment means a zero grade in that assignment.

Your assignment should end with the following statement: *We hereby declare that, except for the code provided by the course instructors, all of our code, report, and figures were produced by ourselves.*

Please note that it is often easy for the instructors to know if you have copied parts of your work from an external source, as we have done the same online searches that you will do, plus coding styles are very evident for someone with experience.

## Getting a grade in the in-class tests or exam

In-class tests and exams are individual work.

Not coming to an in-class test means a zero grade in that in-class test, unless you can justify your absence to the professor (*profesor de teoría*).

**Note**: Copying during a test/exam, knowingly facilitating the copy of others, elaborating, lending, or facilitating instruments for copying during an exam, are considered by the university as serious misconduct ("*falta grave*"). The instructor will make a case for the university to sanction this serious misconduct, as per the university regulations, with a suspension from the university for a minimum of six months and a maximum of four years.
