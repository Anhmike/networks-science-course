# 24233 – Introduction to Networks Science

## Presentation

Graphs are a fundamental data type that is present in a large number of applications. Networks science studies a number of graphs arising in biology, communication, transport, and many diverse areas. In particular, the analysis of social networks and activity traces brings the promise of obtaining insights that are of great importance to sociologists, psychologists, and communication scholars. There are, however, numerous algorithmic challenges on working with large graphs.

This course offers the students the possibility of learning the fundamentals of networks science and to practice by performing basic operations in small and large graphs.

## Associated competences

Logical reasoning. Abstract thinking. Algebra. Basic data structures.

## Results from learning

At the end of the course, the students would have acquired:

* Knowledge on graph theory concepts
* Knowledge on basic centrality measures
* Knowledge on graph clustering
* Knowledge on diffusion ("viral") phenomena
* Techniques for creating graphs from non-graph data
* Techniques for visualizing and analyzing large graphs
* Techniques for detecting dense sub-graphs and performing graph clustering

## Requirements

The course requires:

1. Skills in programming and datas structures.
2. Knowledge of basic linear algebra methods

The course will be delivered in Python, hence it is recommended but not mandatory to have a background in Python.

## Contents

* Why studying networks
* Basics concepts of graph theory
* Degree and degree correlations
* Characterization of complex networks
* Storage of large graphs
* Bipartite graphs
* Basic graph algorithms
* Centrality
* Network flows
* Dense sub-graphs
* Clustering and communities
* Spectral graph clustering
* Spreading phenomena
* Network formation models
* Mining evolving graphs

## Methodology

The course is structured around theory classes in which the topics of the course are introduced.

In seminar sessions, students can work individually or in small groups in performing network analysis tasks. At the end of each session, each student reports his/her findings individually through an image or a 1-2 pages report.

There are three group projects (groups of two students), which integrate the techniques seen in the seminar sessions. There are three practice sessions for instructors to solve student questions regarding these projects.
