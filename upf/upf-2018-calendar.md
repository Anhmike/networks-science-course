| Session(s)       | Topics                                | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
|                  | TT07. Link formation mechanisms       |       |

Calendar restrictions with respect to practice sessions:

* By the end of T7 we must have seen degree distributions
* By the end of T7 we must have seen centrality measures
* By the end of T9 we must have seen k-core decomposition (**this is a tight constraint**)
* By the end of T10 we must have seen spreading phenomena
